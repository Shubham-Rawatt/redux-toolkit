## React Redux Toolkit

Redux works using three core parts: Store (global state), Actions (state-change requests), and Reducers (pure functions that update state).
State is kept in a single immutable store, so every update creates a new version instead of mutating the old one.
Reducers decide how the state should change based on the action’s type and payload.
The predictable structure makes debugging, logging, and time-travel debugging possible in JavaScript apps.
